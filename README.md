# traefik-error-pages

A simple Go server for [Traefik](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/)'s [ErrorPage](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/middlewares/errorpages/) middleware.

Page design and content based on https://github.com/HttpErrorPages/HttpErrorPages.

Inspired by similar work by [Guillaume Briday](https://github.com/guillaumebriday/traefik-custom-error-pages)
and [Prasad Tengse](https://github.com/tprasadtp/traefik-error-pages).

Setup instructions coming soon...
